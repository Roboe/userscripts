# IMSLP Subscription Page Skipper

Avoid waiting 15 seconds when downloading scores on IMSLP. You can still visit the subscription page and look for a variety of ways to keep the IMSLP project alive.

Skip automatically the subscription page of [International Music Score Library Project](http://imslp.org/) (IMSLP). The extension redirects you to the requested download without waiting for 15 seconds when you click a score download button.

You are still able to visit the [subscription page](https://imslp.org/wiki/IMSLP:Subscriptions) to support the IMSLP project economically or [explore other ways to contribute](https://imslp.org/wiki/IMSLP:Contributor_Portal) â€”most of them don't require money, ;)
